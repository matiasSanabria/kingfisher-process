update-collection-caches
========================

This command updates cached values for all collections.

It can be run multiple times on a collection, as updating a cache will not cause any problems.

You should only run one of these at once, as if two are run at once they may try and do the same work.

.. code-block:: shell

    python ocdskingfisher-process-cli update-collection-caches
